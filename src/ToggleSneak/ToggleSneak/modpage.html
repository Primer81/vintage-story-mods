<p>Sneak is now toggleable. No need to hold the button for sneak. Only affects sneaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't like testing the strength of your pinky (or your preferred phalange) while peering over a tall ledge, then this is the mod for you! 😄</p>

<p>Improvements Made:</p>
<ul>
<li>F01:
<ul>
<li>Description:
<ul>
<li>Given
<ul>
<li>sneak is toggled ON and</li>
<li>the "Mouse click modifiers locked to Sneak/Sprint keys" setting is toggled ON,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when the player interacts with right click,</li>
<li>then the right click interaction should be treated as a <em>sneak</em> right click interaction.
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Note: Currently, the player's physical sneaking ability is toggleable, but NOT the interactions associated with sneaking. These include common interactions such as knapping that could benefit from making toggleable alongside physical sneak.</span></li>
</ul>
